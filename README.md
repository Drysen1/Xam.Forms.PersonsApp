# XamarinForms_PersonsApp

This is a demo app to show new developers on how you could use Visual Studio/Xamarin. 
This app is a cross platform app created with Xamarin.Forms PCL it implements the MVVM pattern, 
uses a webservice to communicate with a sql server to get, save, update and delete.

You will have to add the URL to your webservice in XamarinForms_Demo/Services/PersonServices.cs.

Please note that I have only been able to test this app on Android so far (2016-08-29).

To be able to use this demo you will need to download the Webservice application as well: https://github.com/Drysen1/WebAPI_PersonsApp
